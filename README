  Hobsbawm Radio Controller Mk 1

  Arduino-to-DAB radio interface
  
  This code controls a hacked Lava DAB radio.  A single
  pushbutton is connected to the Arduino circuit to 
  control the power on / channel change / power off
  behaviour though a series of single button pushes.
  
  First push - powers radio on from standby mode
  Second push - toggles to station preset 2
  Third push - toggles to station preset 3
  Fourth push - powers radio off to standby mode


  Code based on original code by Tom Igoe
